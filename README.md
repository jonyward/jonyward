        <summary><h3>About Me</h3></summary>
        I'm a recent graduate, currently looking for my first tech job. During secondary school at around 13 or 14 years old, I was taught basic HTML markup which sparked an interest in programming and web development. As well as this I've spent a lot of time building custom PC's for friends and family, and is something I still enjoy doing to this day. <br><br>Building Computers and my early exposure to programming led me to begin studying Computing at Glasgow Caledonian University, where I recently graduated from with a Bachelors of Science in Computing with a First Class Honours classification.
