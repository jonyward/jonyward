        <summary><h3>About Me</h3></summary>
        I'm a recent graduate, currently looking for my first tech job. During secondary school at around 13 or 14 years old, I was taught basic HTML markup which sparked an interest in programming tech overall. As well as this, I spent a lot of time building computers for friends and family, which I have been doing since I was a teenager. <br><br>My Time building computers mixed with an interest in programming and web development led me to attend Glasgow Caledonian University, where I recently graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computing with a First Class Honours classification.
